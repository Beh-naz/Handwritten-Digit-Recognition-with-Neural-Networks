# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-Neural-Networks

### Project Overview
This project aims to build and train two systems for digit classification using neural networks and linear classifiers. These systems take an image as input and return the correct numeric digit.
### Input Data
We use the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. It is uploaded in this folder.

### Sample output

The program produces the following heatmap for one of the digit photos:

### Observation
In this particular case, the heatmap suggests a mix of digit 2 and digit 9.
